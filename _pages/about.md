<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am Barsha Roy, and I am currently a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I have completed my BSc. in Computer Science & Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET) in 2023. My research interests include <strong>Computer Vision, Computer Architecture, Augmented Reality, Scalable AI, and Cyber-Physical Systems.</strong> I have presented and published my work at several reputed international conferences under IEEE and Springer.

<br><br>

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have industry experience as both a UI/UX intern and a Frontend Web Developer, where I contributed to real-world projects using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and React.js.

<br><br>

Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and open to meaningful collaborations.
