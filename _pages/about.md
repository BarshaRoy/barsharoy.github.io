Hello! I’m **Barsha Roy**, currently serving as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the **University of Information Technology and Sciences (UITS), Bangladesh**. I earned my **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering** from **Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET)** in 2023.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, **Computer Architecture**, **Cybersecurity**, **Scalable AI**, and **Cyber-Physical Systems**. I have had the opportunity to present and publish my research at several renowned international conferences, including those organized by **IEEE** and **Springer**.

Alongside my academic journey, I’ve gained hands-on industry experience as a UI/UX Intern and Frontend Web Developer, contributing to real-world projects using technologies such as **Figma**, **Adobe XD**, and **React.js**.

Outside of work, I enjoy **traveling** and **watching movies**.
