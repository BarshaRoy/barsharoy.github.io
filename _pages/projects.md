## Research Projects

### Attention-based Leukemia Classifier  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras  
Applied Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with various built-in and custom CNNs (DenseNet101, ResNet50, EfficientNetB6) to classify leukemia images from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehradaria/leukemia). Grad-CAM was used to visualize regions of interest in the feature maps.  
Published as: *"Attention Mechanism-enhanced Deep CNN Architecture for Precise Multi-Class Leukemia Classification"* (BIM 2023, Springer).
